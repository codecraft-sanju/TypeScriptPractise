The command tsc hello.ts is used to compile a TypeScript file (hello.ts) into JavaScript using the TypeScript compiler (tsc).

Requirements:
You need to have TypeScript installed globally or locally in your project.

Install it globally:
npm install -g typescript

Install it locally in a project:
npm install --save-dev typescript

Run the compiler
tsc hello.ts

If tsc is not recognized, ensure TypeScript is installed correctly by running:
tsc --version

If you want to watch for file changes, use:
tsc hello.ts --watch

--------

tsc -init (is used to initialize a TypeScript project by creating a tsconfig.json file in the current directory.)
